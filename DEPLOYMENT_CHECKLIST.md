## 🎯 Critical Settings Summary

**Most Important Settings** (Don't Miss These!):

| Setting | Value | Why Critical |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| **Root Directory** | `app` | Your Next.js app is in app/ folder |
| **Framework** | Next.js | Ensures correct build process |
| **Build Command** | `npm run build` | Builds production version |
| **Project Name** | `chronos-protocol` | Your URL subdomain |

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Wrong Root Directory

**Mistake**: Leaving Root Directory as `.` (root)  
**Result**: Build fails - can't find Next.js app  
**Fix**: Set Root Directory to `app`

### ❌ Wrong Framework

**Mistake**: Selecting wrong framework preset  
**Result**: Build fails or incorrect configuration  
**Fix**: Select "Next.js"

### ❌ Missing Dependencies

**Mistake**: Not all dependencies in package.json  
**Result**: Build fails with "module not found"  
**Fix**: Ensure all deps are listed (already done ✅)

### ❌ Environment Variables

**Mistake**: Adding unnecessary env vars  
**Result**: Confusion, potential errors  
**Fix**: Don't add any - none needed ✅

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Build Fails

**Check**:
1. Root Directory = `app` ✅
2. Framework = Next.js ✅
3. Build logs for specific error
4. All dependencies in package.json ✅

**Fix**: Redeploy with correct settings

### 404 Error

**Check**:
1. Root Directory setting
2. Pages exist in app/app/ folder ✅
3. Deployment completed successfully

**Fix**: Verify Root Directory = `app`

### Wallet Won't Connect

**Check**:
1. Browser console for errors
2. Using Devnet (not mainnet) ✅
3. Wallet extension installed
4. Correct network in wallet

**Fix**: Switch wallet to Devnet

### Slow Loading

**Check**:
1. First load (cold start) is slower
2. Subsequent loads should be fast
3. Vercel Edge Network active

**Fix**: Normal behavior, wait a moment
